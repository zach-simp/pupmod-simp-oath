# This is an example configuration of oath_users. Secret keys should
# be immediately changed on a production system!
#
# Secret keys should follow RFC 6238 guidelines specified
# in section 5.1
#
#   As indicated in the algorithm requirement section, keys SHOULD be
#   chosen at random or using a cryptographically strong pseudorandom
#   generator properly seeded with a random value.
#
#   Keys SHOULD be of the length of the HMAC output to facilitate
#   interoperability.
#
# Specifics on allowed types can be found in `manifests/config/user.pp`
